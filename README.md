Sales Analytics System – End-to-End Data Pipeline

Student Name: Amriza Farnaz

Submission Date: 15/01/2026

## 📌 Project Overview

In this project, I built a complete sales analytics system that processes raw sales data, cleans and validates records, performs analytical computations, integrates external product data using an API, enriches transactions, and generates a comprehensive business report.

I designed the system using a modular ETL-style architecture to ensure clarity, scalability, and robustness. I implemented proper error handling and user interaction to make the application reliable and user-friendly.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Standard Python libraries (`datetime`, `collections`, `os`)
- **requests** (third-party library for API integration)
- File-based processing (no external databases)

All external dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.


## 🔧 Setup & Run Instructions
### Step 1: Prerequisites

Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

Check Python version:

python --version


### Step 2: Install Required Dependencies
I installed all required third-party libraries using requirements.txt.

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Dependencies are installed via the command line and not inside Python files.


### Step 3: Project Folder Setup

I created the following folders in the project root:

data/
output/

### Step 4: Verify Input File

Ensured the raw sales data file exists in the project root:

sales_data.txt

### Step 5: Run the Application

From the project root directory, run:

python main.py

### Step 6: Output Files Generated

After successful execution, the following files will be created:

File	Description
data/enriched_sales_data.txt	API-enriched sales records
output/sales_report.txt	Final formatted analytics report

### Step 7: Error Handling

Missing input files are handled gracefully

API failures do not crash the program

Invalid user inputs are safely handled


## 🧩 Functional Breakdown
### 🔹 Part 1: Data File Handling & Preprocessing

Reads sales data with encoding handling

Parses pipe-delimited records

Cleans numeric and text fields

Validates transactions using business rules

Produces clean, structured transaction dictionaries

### 🔹 Part 2: Data Processing & Analytics

Implements analytical functions including:

Total revenue calculation

Region-wise sales performance

Top selling products

Customer purchase analysis

Daily sales trends and peak sales day

Low-performing product detection

All analytics are implemented using lists, dictionaries, and functions.

### 🔹 Part 3: API Integration & Data Enrichment

Fetches product data from DummyJSON API

Creates fast product ID mappings

Enriches internal sales transactions with:

Product category

Brand

Rating

Match indicator

Saves enriched sales data to a new file: enriched_sales_data.txt (which is run via main.py and attached to the repository as per mentor's advice.)

### 🔹 Part 4: Comprehensive Text Report

Generates a formatted report including:

Header & metadata

Overall sales summary

Region-wise performance

Top products and customers

Daily sales trends

Product performance analysis

API enrichment success summary

📄 Output: output/sales_report.txt (which is run via main.py and attached to the repository as per mentor's advice.) 

### 🔹 Part 5: Main Application

Provides a guided execution flow

Displays filter options and accepts user input

Executes all processing steps end-to-end

Handles errors gracefully

Prints clear progress updates to the console

Industry-style reporting output

## ✅ Conclusion

This project demonstrates a full data analytics lifecycle, from raw data ingestion to enriched reporting, combining core Python programming, data analysis, API integration, and software design best practices.

### 🎯 Key Learnings

Through this project, I learned how to design and implement a modular ETL pipeline using Python, starting from raw data ingestion to final report generation. I strengthened my understanding of data cleaning and validation by applying business rules to remove invalid records before analysis. I gained practical experience in performing sales analytics using Python data structures such as lists and dictionaries. I learned how to integrate external APIs to enrich internal datasets and handle partial enrichment failures gracefully. Additionally, I improved my ability to write robust, user-friendly applications by implementing error handling, structured console output, and clear documentation aligned with industry standards.

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced & Solutions
Challenge 1: Handling file encoding issues
The sales data file failed to load using UTF-8 encoding. I implemented a fallback mechanism that attempts multiple encodings (utf-8, latin-1, cp1252) to ensure successful file reading. 

Challenge 2: API enrichment failures
Some products could not be matched with API data. I added match indicators and allowed the pipeline to continue while reporting enrichment success rates. The API match showed Products Enriched: 0 due to the PID from the sales_data.txt and dummy jason do not have any PIDs in common.
